I wanted a single look into my cryptocoin holdings but have been unable to find something either web-based, app-based, 
or project that met my needs.  Much of what I found relied on exchange data or manual input of coins.  The problem is
that all of my coin holdings are from mining.  What I want was an app that allows me to:

  1. Enter my wallet address(es)
  2. Follow the blockchain to collect transactions
  3. Determine the cost-basis for the coin when mined
  4. Track the current value of the coin for loss/gain data
  5. Track overall value of the portfolio
  
I have found that CryptoCompare has an API for 600+ coins to track pricing and the API allows for historical lookups.

This project may or may not go anywhere.  If anyone likes the idea, please let me know.
